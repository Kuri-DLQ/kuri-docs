# Group Actions

![redrive-all](../../static/img/redrive-all.png)

Kuri provides two group actions for developers. You can either `Redrive All` messages back to your main queue or `Delete All` messages from your dead-letter queue. Redriving sends the message from the dead-letter queue back to the main queue.
