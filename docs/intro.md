Kuri offers a dead-letter Queue as a Service for Amazon Web Services (AWS)-based microservices architectures. Kuri provides developers with the ability to edit, redrive and delete messages from their dead-letter queue (DLQ). Kuri creates an AWS infrastructure to construct a DLQ with increased functionality and observability for the developer. Kuri can be used when building a brand new project or be added on to an existing project that uses an AWS SQS message queue.
