Kuri is a Dead-Letter Queue-as-a-Service for Amazon Web Services (AWS)-Based Microservices Architectures. It provides the user with the ability to edit, redrive and delete messages from their Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). Kuri creates an AWS infrastructure to construct a DLQ with increased functionality and observability for the user. Kuri can be used when building a brand new project or added on to an existing project that uses a message queue.
